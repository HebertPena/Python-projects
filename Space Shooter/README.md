# SPACE SHOOTER 0.1V
  
  This is my first game on pygame. I'm using this project to learn and praticing POO.
  Whenever I feel like, I'll update this project with new functionalities and improve the game.
  My Goal is that in the end, I have a game that is fun to play and not just a generic space shooter like it is right now.
